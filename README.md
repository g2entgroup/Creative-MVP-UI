UI for MVP

To run the project against a local node you can use the pooltogether-contracts. With those contracts you can bootstrap a local Buidler EVM instance with test data so that you can develop the app locally.

Setup
Install dependencies:

$ yarn
Make sure you have direnv installed and copy .envrc.example to .envrc:

$ cp .envrc.example .envrc
Fill in your own values for .envrc, then run:

$ direnv allow
To run the local server, run:

$ yarn dev
